## Project Description
  SmartFarm is an application that enables agricultural industries to transition to digital registration process of smallholder farmers and provide a platform for training them.The application relies on form validation techniques for inputing data, performs DOM manipulation using ReactJs and fetches data from JSON server.

  - Extract files from the zip file.
  - Open the extracted folder with vscode.
  - On your VS Code terminal run `npm start` to run the app and expose our local server

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you should run:

  ### `npm start`
  Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  This script also runs `json-server --watch ./data/db.json` to expose our backend server on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
